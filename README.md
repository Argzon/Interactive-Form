# Interactive-Form

An interactive form to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference. In this form we gather information like Basic Info, T-Shirt Info, Registration of Activities and also the payment information.

# Realtime validation

## Payment info

### Credit Card Number

Im checking if the card number field is empty and then display the error sign and message telling that this field cannot be empty.
Also in the next cenario I check if the user enters different characters than letter and let them know that this form accepts letters only.
When the user starts writing the numbers, a warn message appears telling them that the credit card numbers are between 13 and 16.
When the user enters a valid credit card number a green check âœ… appears informing the user that the credit card number is correct.

### Zip Code

The same validation as above goes for the Zip Code field also. The only difference here is that the user is required to enter 5 numbers.

### CVV

In the CVV field, the user is required to enter 3 numbers as the credit card has. The validation is the same as the two validations above.
